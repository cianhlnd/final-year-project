      <p>Welcome to the Football Coaching Hub. My name is Cian Hyland. I am a current student in Maynooth University where I am
      in the final year of my computer science degree. I was tasked with creating an interactive web application
      for my final year project. After brainstorming a few ideas I ended up deciding on an area I am very passionate about,
      grassroots football coaching. I have built up 6 years worth of football coaching experience, ranging from very young
      kids all the way to u12s players. From these experiences I have gained gained a competency for football coaching
      which I still use to this day. Currently I am a co-manager of the u9s Lucan United blue team in the DDSL as well as coach for 
      2 Coerver performance academies. Throughout my studies as a coach I have researched many different coaching philosophies
      and methodolgies and have added an array of coaching qualifcations onto this knowledge bank. 
      </p>
      <ul>
      My qualifcations include:
      <li>PDP 1,2 and 3 courses</li>
      <li>Garda Vetting</li>
      <li>Child Safeguarding 1</li>
      <li> Coerver Youth Diploma 1 as well as various workshops</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
      I have developed this web application to tailor torwards age groups I feel comfortable sharing my knowledge base on 
      through coaching them in the past. This is why this web application is for small-sided game coaches. The goal of this 
      web application is simple, to make the lives of volunteer small-sided coaches easier.
