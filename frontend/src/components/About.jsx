      <h1>About Us</h1>
      <p>The goal of the website is simple. To improve make the
        lives of volunteer coaches that much easier. I have combined both my passion for grassroots coaching
        with my current course to create this application. I have 5 years experience coaching beginning my journey
        working in academy football with my local club Lucan United completing TY work experience.
        My journey then lead me to where I am today where I currently manage the u9s blue team for the same club
        along with working for a global leader in football skill training called Coerver Coaching.
        I am Garda Vetted, have my child safeguarding 1 completed, PDP 1, 2 and 3 courses completed
        along with completing Coerver coaching workshops and a 7vs7 FAI workshop. With these qualifications
        and my own experience I have developed custom session plans for coaches to use to improve the quality of their own sessions.
